## Cloning

Hi, this is Dexter. If you want to know how to clone my notes, which is divided into submodules, you can either clone from each of their repository, or clone everything using this repository.

Since you are already here, I will tell you how to clone this repo.

So, before I begin, I want to say that I am joking! Yes, I will not tell you directly.

If you want to clone this repo and the notes inside properly (since you will only have empty folders at first), you will have to learn it yourself. 

Go to this page and read.

That's it!

## Submodules

Getting the status and current branch
`git submodule update status`

Checkout to latest branch in remote
